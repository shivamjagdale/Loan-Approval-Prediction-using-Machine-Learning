Loan Prediction using Machine Learning 💻🤖📊
Here we are building a system to see whether a person is eligible for a loan or not. 🏦💸

Consider that there is a Finance Company/Bank 🏦 that gives out loans to people. Before approving the loan, this company analyzes the various credentials of a person. There are several aspects like whether a person is educated 🎓, graduated 🎓, married 💍, etc.

The company/bank wants to automate this loan process. The user or person fills an online application 📝💻 and based on the info given by the user, we need to develop a Machine Learning system that can tell if a person is eligible for a loan or not. 🤔✅❌
