# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Loan Prediction using Machine Learning 💻🤖📊
Here we are building a system to see whether a person is eligible for a loan or not. 🏦💸

Consider that there is a Finance Company/Bank 🏦 that gives out loans to people. Before approving the loan, this company analyzes the various credentials of a person. There are several aspects like whether a person is educated 🎓, graduated 🎓, married 💍, etc.

The company/bank wants to automate this loan process. The user or person fills an online application 📝💻 and based on the info given by the user, we need to develop a Machine Learning system that can tell if a person is eligible for a loan or not. 🤔✅❌

We will follow the standard work-flow for this project like finding the data, data analysis 📊, data pre-processing 🛠️, train and testing the data 🧪, etc.

Here we are using Support Vector Machine as our learning model. 📈🤖

After we are done with training and testing the data, we will give our own input and let the model predict the outcome. 🧩🔮

Here the model got 81% on training data 📚✅ and 80% on testing data 🧪✅ which is really good. 👍🌟
